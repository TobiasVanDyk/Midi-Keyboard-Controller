## Midi Keyboard Controller using a CMOS V20 CPU and programmed in 8088 assembler


Create the file 8088.ASM by:   
```                                    
COPY 8088RAM.1 + 8088RAM.2 + 8088ROM1 + 8088ROM2  8088.ASM
```

Pcb.zip has the PCB mask layouts in Wintek smART-WORK format

Photo 1 to Photo 4 has front and back details of the PCB's.

Two videos of the live system are included as Video of CPU Box.mp4 and Keyboard and CPU_1.mp4.
